# Document types

Documents follow a naming convention to help users interpret what type of sample document is being viewed.

`"{doc type indicator}{year}-{month}.{sequence}B{batchName}.docx"`
doc type indicator - a letter or abbreviation indicator.  For example, documents starting with "C" are intended to be contracts.
year-month - an date part that can be used for filters and sorting.
sequence - an iteration counter to help make each file name unique.
batchName - a batch name to maintain unique file names across iterations.
